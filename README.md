# esp32-mqtt-rg9
Linking up the Hydreon RG-9 rain sensor to a ESP32. 
The output signal of the RG-9 triggers a "it's raining" mesage to MQTT, while serial output from the sensor is send to MQTT as status messages.
The goal is to integrate with OpenHAB for automatic closing of Velux windows when rain starts.

This a work-in-progress, not ready for rollout. Once completed I'll remove this line.
